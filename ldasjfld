###Task: User System that can create a new user (first name, last name, username > tuple) or print all current users. We will use EasyGUI to ask our questions/makeusers and to print our list.

###Access EasyGUI
import easygui as easy

###List definitions
current_users = []

###User Data Types (Temporary)
first_name = ""
last_name = ""
username = ""

###Helper Functions

def MakeUser():
  first_name = easy.enterbox("what is your first name?", "question 1")
  last_name = easy.enterbox("what is your last name?", "question 2")
  return (first_name, last_name)
#StoreUser - Take output from MakeUser and append to current_users

current_users.append(MakeUser())
#PrintUsers - Prints all current users
print(current_users)
#Optional: Check for numerics in first and last - use with make a user?
#Optional: Random Username based on first name


###Main Program Loop
#Conditions to run our program and ask our questions
#Way to exit the program (Stops the while loop)
#MakeUser()
